## 🌌 The Experience

### 🔭 Observatory Mode (Signature Feature)
The crown jewel of this experience. By activating the **Observatory Telescope**, users are transported from the gallery to the depths of the cosmos.
*   **Real-Time Luna**: The moon's phase and shadow position synchronize with your **local real-world time**.
*   **The C.A.T. Impact**: Look closely at the moon surface to find the legendary *Felis Crater*.
*   **Cosmic Traffic**: Watch the sky for passing **Satellites**, spinning **Space Debris**, and the erratic, high-speed **UFOs** (click them if you dare!).
*   **The Event Horizon**: A super-rare (5% chance) **Black Hole** event that distorts the calmness of space.

### ✨ Atmospheric Design
*   **Lantern Cursor**: A custom physics-based lighting system that follows your mouse, illuminating the darkness.
*   **Constellation Particles**: A starfield that reacts to your presence, forming connections as you explore.
*   **3D Tilt Cards**: Gallery items float and rotate in 3D space, responding to your cursor's gravity.
*   **Sonic Journey**: Integrated BGM player with volume control to set the perfect mood.
*   **Dual Realms**: Switch between **Minecraft** (Night/Moon) and **Hytale** (Forest/Adventure) themes with a seamless Genshin-style transition.
